      Sets the maximum number of temperature data points that can be stored
      in the internal memory buffer before downsampling occurs.

      Note: This value should be an even number to ensure proper memory
      alignment and symmetry if data merging logic relies on pairs.
      (Current setting: 576 data points = 2 days @ 5 minute sampling).

      If enabled, the main application's entry point (main.c) is excluded
      and replaced by a test suite runner's main() function.
